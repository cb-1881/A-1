# A-1
TODO:
Fix infix part ....DONE


INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING:
cd into A-1
Run Make and then Make run :)

ISSUE:
The junit test i provided in TestLinkedListWithIterator
wasn't working properly in my makefile so If you have an Intellij IDE
it will compile and run properly but all my tests passed
I just ran out of time on configuring the makefile for ease of access 
Sorry about that :(
